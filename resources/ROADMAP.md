# üõ£Ô∏è What does the future hold

The future of Glitter is bright, and we're excited to share our roadmap with you. It all starts with a simple
consolidation effort:

- [x] Import the old `Glitter.Extensions` repo.
    - [x] Add the old repo to this one.
    - [x] Find proper namespaces for existing extensions.
    - [x] Move files from the dedicated project into the primary project.
    - [x] Consolidate unit tests.
- [x] Import the old `Glitter.Sql` repo.
    - [x] Add the old repo to this one.
    - [x] Create the official `Glitter.Data.Sql` namespace in the `Glitter` project.
    - [x] Move files from the dedicated project into the primary project.
    - [x] Consolidate unit tests.

Our next steps involve adding new features to the consolidated repo:

- [ ] Add abstractions for common design patterns.
- [ ] Add support for encapsulation of individual workloads.
- [ ] Add support for pipelines.
- [ ] Add support for encapsulated API interactions.
- [ ] Add support for encapsulated file interactions.
- [ ] Complete support for encapsulated SQL interactions.

These particular features have a long way to go, but we're excited to discuss them and get your feedback in our
discussions area.
