Comprised of multiple repositories, Glitter offers a flexible package experience. Each repository serves their own purpose and responsibility, allowing for a more focused approach to development, and a more modular approach to implementation. The following repositories are part of the framework:

- [Glitter](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Glitter)
  - [Glitter.Sql](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Glitter.Sql)
  - [Glitter.Api](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Glitter.Api)
  - [Glitter.Pipelines](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Glitter.Pipelines)
- [Glitter.Extensions](https://github.com/tacosontitan/Glitter.Extensions)
