## üõ¢Ô∏è Encapsulating SQL Requests

Glitter offers several ways to encapsulate SQL requests:

- [SqlStoredProcedure](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlStoredProcedure.cs)
- [SqlTableFunction](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlTableFunction.cs)
- [SqlScalarFunction](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlScalarFunction.cs)
- [SqlScript](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlScript.cs)

The encapsulation strategy employed by Glitter is definition driven. This means that your encapsulations simply define a request to execute a stored procedure, function, or query. The encapsulation does not actually execute the request, but rather provides a means to execute the request. For example, the following encapsulation defines a request to execute a stored procedure:

```csharp
public class UserInsertRequest
    : SqlStoredProcedure
{
    public UserInsertRequest(string username, string givenName, string surname)
        : base(schema: "Sample", name: "UserInsert")
    {
        _ = AddParameter("Username", username, DbType.String, length: 100);
        _ = AddParameter("GivenName", givenName, DbType.String, length: 100);
        _ = AddParameter("Surname", surname, DbType.String, length: 100);
    }
}
```
