## üõ£Ô∏è What does the future hold

The future of Glitter is bright, and we're excited to share our roadmap with you. It all starts with a simple consolidation effort:

- [x] Import the old `Glitter.Extensions` repo.
  - [x] Add the old repo to this one.
  - [x] Find proper namespaces for existing extensions.
  - [x] Move files from the dedicated project into the primary project.
  - [x] Consolidate unit tests.
- [ ] Import the old `Glitter.Sql` repo.
  - [x] Add the old repo to this one.
  - [x] Create the official `Glitter.Data.Sql` namespace in the `Glitter` project.
  - [ ] Move files from the dedicated project into the primary project.
  - [ ] Consolidate unit tests.

Our next steps involve adding new features to the consolidated repo:

- [ ] Add support for encapsulation of individual workloads.
- [ ] Complete support for encapsulated SQL interactions.
- [ ] Add support for pipelines.
- [ ] Add support for encapsulated API interactions.
- [ ] Add support for encapsulated file interactions.

These particular features have a long way to go, but we're excited to discuss them and get your feedback in our discussions area.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Encapsulating SQL Requests

Glitter offers several ways to encapsulate SQL requests:

- [SqlStoredProcedure](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlStoredProcedure.cs)
- [SqlTableFunction](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlTableFunction.cs)
- [SqlScalarFunction](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlScalarFunction.cs)
- [SqlScript](./src/Glitter.Sql/Encapsulation/SqlScript.cs)

The encapsulation strategy employed by Glitter is definition driven. This means that your encapsulations simply define a request to execute a stored procedure, function, or query. The encapsulation does not actually execute the request, but rather provides a means to execute the request. For example, the following encapsulation defines a request to execute a stored procedure:

```csharp
public class UserInsertRequest
    : SqlStoredProcedure
{
    public UserInsertRequest(string username, string givenName, string surname)
        : base(schema: "Sample", name: "UserInsert")
    {
        _ = AddParameter("Username", username, DbType.String, length: 100);
        _ = AddParameter("GivenName", givenName, DbType.String, length: 100);
        _ = AddParameter("Surname", surname, DbType.String, length: 100);
    }
}
```
